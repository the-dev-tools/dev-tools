"The Software" means the DevTools codebase and associated
documentation that is distributed under this license, including any
portion of it.

"The Licensor" means the DevTools Contributors who hold copyright in
the Software.

"You" means the individual or entity accepting this license.

"Your Company" means any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other
organization that you work for, plus any entity that controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with that organization.

"Internal Business Use" means use of the Software by you or Your
Company solely for your own workflows and operations, without offering
the Software itself, or any service whose primary value is the
Software, to third parties.

"Non-Commercial / Personal Use" means use of the Software by an
individual for private purposes where no one is paying for access to
the Software or to a service whose primary value is the Software.

"Commercial Redistribution" means distributing the Software, or a
derivative of the Software, or providing access to it, as a product or
service for which you or Your Company receive a fee or other monetary
compensation, where the primary value of what is being sold is the
Software's functionality.

3. Copyright License

Subject to the limitations in this license, the Licensor grants you a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable license to:

- use the Software for Internal Business Use or Non-Commercial /
  Personal Use;
- copy the Software;
- modify the Software and prepare derivative works;
- distribute the Software or derivative works to others free of charge
  for Non-Commercial / Personal Use, provided all such distribution
  complies with Section 5 (Notices) and Section 4 (Limitations).

4. Limitations (No SaaS, No Resale)

You may NOT engage in Commercial Redistribution of the Software unless
you have a separate written commercial license from the Licensor.

In particular, without such a commercial license, you may NOT:

- sell the Software or any modified version of it as a product;
- license, rent, lease, or otherwise charge a fee specifically for
  access to the Software;
- offer the Software, or any modified version of it, as a hosted,
  managed, or "software as a service" product where the Software (or a
  derivative of it) is a primary component of the paid offering;
- distribute binaries or hosted instances of the Software to third
  parties for a fee where the core value arises substantially from the
  Software's functionality.

Using the Software as a tool in your own business, including for
paid consulting, development, or operational services, is allowed as
long as:

- you are not providing the Software itself (or a rebranded version)
  to your customers; and
- your customers are paying you for your services, not for access to
  DevTools as a product.

5. Notices and Redistribution

If you distribute any copy of the Software, or a derivative work, you
must:

- include this license text and the above copyright notice; and
- not remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or attribution
  notices contained in the Software; and
- clearly indicate any changes you have made to the Software.

You may only distribute the Software or derivative works free of
charge and for Non-Commercial / Personal Use, unless you have a
separate commercial license from the Licensor.

6. Third-Party Components

Any third-party components included in the Software are licensed under
their own applicable licenses. Nothing in this license overrides or
replaces the terms of those third-party licenses.

7. Patents

The Licensor grants you a license, under any patent claims the
Licensor can license and that are necessarily infringed by the
unmodified Software, to make, have made, use, and distribute the
Software as permitted by this license.

This patent license:

- is subject to the limitations and conditions of this license; and
- does not apply to any modifications or derivative works that you
create.

If you or Your Company make any written claim in any forum that the
Software infringes or contributes to the infringement of a patent,
your patent license under this Section 7 terminates immediately.

8. No Other Rights

Except for the rights expressly granted in this license, no other
rights are granted. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by
the Licensor.

Nothing in this license grants you any rights to use the names, logos,
or trademarks of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
customary use in describing the origin of the Software.

9. Termination

If you use the Software in violation of this license, your rights
under this license automatically terminate.

If the Licensor notifies you in writing of a violation and you cease
all violations within 30 days of receipt of that notice, your license
may be reinstated retroactively at the Licensor's discretion. If you
violate this license again after reinstatement, your rights terminate
permanently.

10. No Warranty; Limitation of Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF
ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT,
OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
